A toy compiler for a toy language.

=== Dependencies ==
* https://github.com/dwyer/da

=== LICENSE ===

Some of the code was ported from the Go language [1], so I've included their
license.

Unit tests are borrowed from Nora Sandler's "Write a Compiler" series [2][3]
so her LICENSE is included as well (under stages/).
